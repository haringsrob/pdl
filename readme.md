# Php debug logger

This is an implementation for the [Universal debug logger](https://github.com/haringsrob/udl).

Install it with composer (dev dependency) and after that you can
use:

```
pdl($value, 'label');
```

$value can by anything, label is optional and will default
to the current datetime.
